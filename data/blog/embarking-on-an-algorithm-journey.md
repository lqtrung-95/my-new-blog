## Introduction

Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of algorithms? Join me, a fellow novice who has tackled over 300 LeetCode problems in recent months, and let's learn together! 🚀 In this post, I'll share my approach to learning algorithms on LeetCode, starting with easy problems and progressing to medium and hard ones. I'm thrilled to connect with like-minded learners and create a supportive community to explore the fascinating realm of algorithms.

## 1. My LeetCode Experience 🚀:

As a beginner in the world of algorithms, my journey on LeetCode has been both challenging and rewarding. I started with simple problems, gradually building confidence in my problem-solving abilities. With each solved challenge, my excitement and enthusiasm for algorithms grew, fueling my determination to master this fascinating domain.

🌟 However, the journey is more enjoyable when shared with others. I am eager to connect with fellow learners who are also exploring the world of algorithms. Together, we can form study groups, share insights, and support each other through the learning process. Let's create a collaborative community where we can celebrate successes and tackle obstacles as we embark on this algorithmic adventure.

## 2. Learning Roadmap 🗺️:

Based on my experience, I've outlined an effective roadmap for new learners to navigate the vast landscape of algorithms. The key is to start with easy problems, allowing you to grasp fundamental concepts and familiarize yourself with common problem-solving techniques. Focus on understanding the underlying algorithms and their applications before moving on.

🔑 Once you've established a strong foundation, it's time to progress to medium-level problems. This stage is crucial for honing your skills and gaining confidence in tackling more complex challenges. By leveraging the knowledge gained from solving easier problems, you'll be well-prepared to embrace the intricacies of medium-difficulty algorithms.

🚀 As you gain proficiency and algorithmic maturity, challenge yourself further with hard problems. These advanced challenges push your problem-solving abilities to new heights and offer insights into real-world problem-solving scenarios. Don't be discouraged by initial difficulties; instead, see them as opportunities for growth and learning.

Here is an recommended roadmap that I have followed and find it very efficient from neetcode.io
