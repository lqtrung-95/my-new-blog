Frontend system design interviews can be intimidating, but with the right framework, you can approach them systematically and confidently. Today, we'll explore the **RADIO framework** - a structured methodology that has helped countless engineers excel in their frontend system design interviews.

_Special thanks to [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/) for their comprehensive system design resources that inspired this guide._

## Why Structure Matters in System Design

Unlike coding interviews with clear right/wrong answers, system design interviews are open-ended and deliberately vague. This ambiguity is intentional - interviewers want to see how you think, prioritize, and communicate complex technical concepts.

The RADIO framework provides the structure you need to:

- ‚úÖ Navigate ambiguous requirements systematically
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate comprehensive technical thinking
- ‚úÖ Show real-world engineering judgment
- ‚úÖ Communicate effectively under pressure

## The RADIO Framework Breakdown

**RADIO** stands for:

- **R**equirements exploration
- **A**rchitecture / High-level design
- **D**ata model / Core entities
- **I**nterface definition (API)
- **O**ptimizations and deep dive

Let's dive into each phase:

## üîç R - Requirements Exploration (15% of time)

**Objective**: Transform a vague problem statement into concrete, actionable requirements.

### Key Questions to Ask

**Scope and Focus**

```
- What are the main use cases we should focus on?
- Which features define this product's core value?
- What are the functional vs. non-functional requirements?
```

**Technical Constraints**

```
- What devices/platforms need support? (desktop/mobile/tablet)
- Is offline functionality required?
- What are our performance targets?
- Who are the primary users?
```

### Example: "Design Facebook"

Instead of diving into implementation, clarify:

- Focus on news feed, not messaging or groups
- Support web desktop and mobile
- Handle thousands of posts efficiently
- Prioritize content loading speed

**Pro Tip**: Write down agreed requirements and refer back to them throughout the interview.

## üèóÔ∏è A - Architecture / High-level Design (20% of time)

**Objective**: Identify key components and their relationships in your frontend system.

### Common Frontend Components

| Component        | Purpose         | Example Responsibilities     |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Server**       | Backend APIs    | Data storage, business logic |
| **View**         | User interface  | Rendering, user interactions |
| **Controller**   | Data flow       | API calls, state management  |
| **Client Store** | Data management | Caching, app-wide state      |

### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear, distinct responsibility
2. **Data Flow**: Define how information moves between components
3. **Computation Location**: Decide what happens client-side vs. server-side

### Example Architecture: News Feed

  height={600}
/>

## üìä D - Data Model / Core Entities (10% of time)

**Objective**: Define what data exists in your system and where it lives.

### Types of Frontend Data

1. **Server-originated**: User profiles, posts, comments
2. **Client-only persistent**: Form inputs, user preferences
3. **Client-only ephemeral**: UI state, loading indicators

### Example Data Model: News Feed

| Source | Entity    | Component     | Fields                                              |
| ------ | --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Server | `Post`    | Feed UI       | `id`, `content`, `author`, `timestamp`, `reactions` |
| Server | `User`    | Client Store  | `id`, `name`, `avatar_url`                          |
| Server | `Feed`    | Feed UI       | `posts[]`, `pagination`, `hasMore`                  |
| Client | `NewPost` | Post Composer | `message`, `image`, `isSubmitting`                  |
| Client | `UIState` | Feed UI       | `selectedTab`, `isRefreshing`                       |

## üîå I - Interface Definition (15% of time)

**Objective**: Define how components communicate with each other.

### Server-Client APIs

```javascript
// GET /api/feed
Request: {
  cursor: "eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ==",
  limit: 20
}

Response: {
  posts: [
    {
      id: "123",
      content: "Hello world!",
      author: {
        id: "456",
        name: "John Doe",
        avatar: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
      },
      timestamp: "2025-06-15T10:30:00Z",
      reactions: { likes: 42, shares: 5 }
    }
  ],
  pagination: {
    nextCursor: "eyJpZCI6MTI0fQ==",
    hasMore: true
  }
}
```

### Client-Client APIs

```javascript
// Component communication
class FeedController {
  async loadFeed(cursor = null) {
    const response = await fetchFeed({ cursor, limit: 20 })
    this.store.updateFeed(response)
    return response
  }

  async createPost(content) {
    const post = await submitPost(content)
    this.store.prependPost(post)
    return post
  }
}
```

## ‚ö° O - Optimizations and Deep Dive (40% of time)

**Objective**: Demonstrate deep technical knowledge and real-world engineering judgment.

### Performance Optimizations

**Loading Performance**

- Implement virtual scrolling for long feeds
- Use image lazy loading and progressive JPEGs
- Implement critical CSS and code splitting
- Add service worker for caching strategies

**Runtime Performance**

- Debounce search inputs and scroll events
- Use React.memo() or similar for expensive components
- Implement efficient diff algorithms for feed updates
- Add skeleton screens for perceived performance

### User Experience Enhancements

**Responsive Design**

```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.feed-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .feed-container {
    flex-direction: row;
    gap: 2rem;
  }
}
```

**Error Handling**

- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Show meaningful error messages
- Provide offline fallbacks
- Add loading states and progress indicators

### Scalability Considerations

**State Management**

```javascript
// Efficient feed state management
const feedReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOAD_POSTS':
      return {
        ...state,
        posts: [...state.posts, ...action.posts],
        isLoading: false,
      }
    case 'UPDATE_POST':
      return {
        ...state,
        posts: state.posts.map((post) => (post.id === action.post.id ? action.post : post)),
      }
  }
}
```

**Network Optimization**

- Implement request batching and deduplication
- Use GraphQL for precise data fetching
- Add optimistic updates for better UX
- Implement progressive loading strategies

### Security & Accessibility

**Security Measures**

- Sanitize user-generated content (XSS prevention)
- Implement CSP headers
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Validate inputs on both client and server

**Accessibility Features**

```jsx
// Accessible feed post component
const FeedPost = ({ post }) => (
  <article role="article" aria-labelledby={`post-${post.id}-title`} tabIndex={0}>
    <h2 id={`post-${post.id}-title`} className="sr-only">
      Post by {post.author.name}
    </h2>
    <button aria-label={`Like post by ${post.author.name}`} onClick={handleLike}>
      üëç {post.likes}
    </button>
  </article>
)
```
