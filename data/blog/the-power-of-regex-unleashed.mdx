# The Power of Regex Unleashed! ‚ú®üîç

Regular expressions, also known as regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. üéØ

## What is Regex?

Regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It can be used to match, search, and manipulate text based on specific patterns. üß©

## Why Use Regex?

Regex can be incredibly useful in various scenarios, such as:

- Validating input data
- Extracting specific information from text
- Replacing or modifying text
- Searching for patterns in large datasets

## Basic Regex Syntax

Regex patterns are composed of a combination of characters and special symbols. Here are some commonly used symbols:

- `.`: Matches any single character.
- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `[]`: Matches any single character within the brackets.
- `^`: Matches the start of a line.
- `$`: Matches the end of a line.

## Examples

Let's look at a few examples to understand how regex works:

- To match any email address, you can use the pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`.

  - Breakdown:
    - `^`: Matches the start of the line.
    - `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches one or more occurrences of any letter, digit, dot, underscore, percent, plus, or minus.
    - `@`: Matches the "@" symbol.
    - `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches one or more occurrences of any letter, digit, dot, or hyphen.
    - `\.`: Matches a dot.
    - `[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: Matches two or more occurrences of any letter.
    - `$`: Matches the end of the line.

- To extract all URLs from a text, you can use the pattern `(https?|ftp)://[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*`.

  - Breakdown:
    - `(https?|ftp)`: Matches either "http", "https", or "ftp".
    - `://`: Matches "://" literally.
    - `[^\s/$.?#]`: Matches any character except whitespace, "/", "$", ".", "?", or "#".
    - `.`: Matches a dot.
    - `[^\s]*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of any character except whitespace.

- To format phone numbers in a consistent way, you can use the pattern `(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})` and the replacement string `($1) $2-$3`.
  - Breakdown:
    - `(\d{3})`: This part of the regex matches three consecutive digits. The `\d` represents any digit from `0` to `9`, and the `{3}` specifies that we want exactly three occurrences of the preceding pattern. The parentheses `()` are used to capture this group of three digits.
    - `(\d{3})`: This part of the regex is similar to the previous one. It also matches three consecutive digits and captures them in a group.
    - `(\d{4})`: This part of the regex matches four consecutive digits and captures them in a group.

```javascript
const phoneNumber = '1234567890'
const formattedPhoneNumber = phoneNumber.replace(/(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/, '($1) $2-$3')

console.log(formattedPhoneNumber) // Output: (123) 456-7890
```

## Conclusion

Regex is a powerful tool that can save you time and effort when working with text. By mastering regex, you can unlock a whole new level of text manipulation possibilities. So go ahead, dive into the world of regex and unleash its power! üí™üöÄ
