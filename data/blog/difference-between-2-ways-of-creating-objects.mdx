In JavaScript, when we want to make an object, there are different ways to do it. 🧐 Let's explore two common methods to do it and the difference between them.

## 1. Curly Braces `{}`:

When we use curly braces to make an object like `let myObject = {};`, we get a default set of properties and methods that come with every object. 🏠 These are like the "standard features" that every object gets from JavaScript.

Imagine it's like buying a new smartphone. 📱 You get the usual apps and features that come with every phone. Similarly, when you create an object with curly braces, you get some standard things, like a `toString` method, whether you asked for them or not!

**Example:**

```js
// Creating an object with curly braces
let myObject = {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2',
}

// It inherits default properties from Object.prototype
console.log(myObject.toString()) // Outputs: [object Object]
```

## 2. Object.create(null):

Now, if you want to create an object without all those default things, you can use Object.create(null). 🚀 This is like getting a brand new, empty backpack where you can decide what to put in without any surprises.

It's like customizing your own phone. 🛠️ You pick and choose what apps you want without any pre-installed ones. Similarly, Object.create(null) gives you a fresh object without inherited properties, so you can have more control.

**Example:**

```js
// Creating an object with Object.create(null)
let cleanObject = Object.create(null)

// No inherited properties, a clean slate
console.log(cleanObject.toString) // Outputs: undefined
```

## Why does it matter? 🤔

Imagine you're building a cool robot with different parts. 🤖 If you use curly braces, it's like getting some default parts that you might not need. But with `Object.create(null)`, it's like starting with a blank canvas to build your robot exactly the way you want.

In the code example you shared, this.\_events = `Object.create(null)`; is a way of saying, "I want an object without any extra stuff, just the things I put in it."

One common use case for `Object.create(null)` is when you want to use an object as a dictionary. 📖 Since it doesn't have any inherited properties, you can use it to store key-value pairs without worrying about name collisions with inherited properties.

For example, if you want to store a key called `toString`, you can't do that with curly braces because it's already taken by the default toString method. But with `Object.create(null)`, you can do it without any issues.

So, whether you prefer the default features or want a clean slate to build your own, JavaScript gives you options with curly braces and `Object.create(null)`. 🌟 Choose the one that fits your project best!
